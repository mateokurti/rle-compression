# Basic Computer Graphics - RLE Compression
> PLEASE NOTE: This solution was implemented as an exercise and do not necessarily provides the best solution for a real world use case.

## Demo

You can test the application online by using OneCompiler. Consider the following URIs

### Grayscale RLE Compression
https://onecompiler.com/cpp/3xwwcxw3y

### RGB RLE Compression
https://onecompiler.com/cpp/3xwwcrsas

## Run Project Locally
Clone the project by running the following command
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mateokurti/rle-compression.git && cd rle-compression
```

Run the RGB RLE Compression:
```bash
g++ rle_rgb.cpp -o rle_rgb && ./rle_rgb
```

or

Run the Grayscale RLE Compression:
```bash
g++ rle_grayscale.cpp -o rle_grayscale && ./rle_grayscale
```
